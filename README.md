# ymix_core AI System Demonstration

## Overview

ymix_core is a terminal-style demonstration of an advanced AI system's capabilities. This project presents a simulated command-line interface showcasing various AI functionalities through an interactive or automated demo.

## Features

- **Classic Terminal Interface**: Black and white command-line aesthetic with ASCII art
- **Multiple AI Capabilities Showcased**:
  - Natural Language Understanding
  - Pattern Recognition & Prediction
  - Multi-modal Processing
  - Real-time Data Analysis
  - Adaptive Learning
- **Two Demo Modes**:
  - Interactive Mode: Users type commands to explore the system
  - Auto-Demo Mode: Hands-off demonstration that cycles through capabilities

## Technical Implementation

This demonstration is built using:
- React.js for the interactive interface
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom ASCII art renderings
- Simulated loading/processing sequences

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ymix-core-demo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ymix-core-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

## Usage

### Interactive Demo

The interactive demo allows users to type commands to explore different AI capabilities:

1. Press any key at the title screen to begin
2. Type `initiate demonstration sequence` to view capabilities
3. Try the following commands to see different demos:
   - `analyze sentiment in dataset alpha-7`
   - `detect anomalies in network traffic log beta-12`
   - `process manufacturing quality inspection data from plant C`
   - `show learning progression on medical diagnosis dataset`
4. Type `exit` to return to the beginning

Type `help` at any time to see available commands.

### Auto-Demo Mode

The auto-demo mode runs through all capabilities without requiring user input. This is ideal for:
- Trade show displays
- Background visuals during presentations
- Website demonstrations

## Customization

You can customize the demonstration by modifying:

- `asciiLogo` constant to change the header graphic
- Scene content in the `scenes` array to modify demonstrations
- Timing parameters for auto-progression
- Color scheme through Tailwind CSS classes
